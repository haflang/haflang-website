      <h2>Workshop Scope</h2>

      <p>
          The 1960s and 1970s saw LISP machines for supporting AI workloads. The 1980s saw
          graph reductions machines for functional language workloads. After a 30 year
          lull, modern hardware technology has attracted renewed interest in hardware
          acceleration of high level languages. This workshop brings together computer
          architects and programming language implementers to identify software/hardware
          co-designs of these high level execution models.
      </p>

      <p>
          We invite two forms of participation: (1) submissions for
          30 minute talks, (2) 5-10 minute lightning talks about related
          projects and early results. Please send an abstract to <a href="mailto:craig.ramsay@hw.ac.uk">craig.ramsay@hw.ac.uk</a> by November 20<sup>th</sup>.
          We are looking for submissions that cover the
          motivation, design, or real-world application of hardware technology
          for functional/declarative languages, their compilers and runtime
          systems. The work should target truly custom (e.g. ASIC/FPGA)
          hardware, or exploit modern hardware features for
          functional/declarative language implementation, across the design
          space of:
      </p>

      <ul class="icon-list">
        <li>Special-purpose processor architectures for functional or declarative languages.
        </li>
        <li>Automatic, high-level synthesis of custom accelerators from plain, high-level
            software functions.
        </li>
        <li> Hardware description languages embedded in, or hosted by, high-level
            software languages.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
          Demonstrating these themes, we are excited to announce <b>Christiaan
          Baaij</b> (QBayLogic) and <b>Carl-Johan Seger</b> (Chalmers University) as
          <b>invited speakers</b>.

                    Clash is a functional hardware description language, but it’s also just a
                    combination of a regular Haskell library with type and function definitions for
                    circuit design and a compiler that translates Haskell programs to digital
                    circuits.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are many ways a Haskell program can be interpreted as a circuit
                description, where the Clash project picks a particular one. Even more broadly,
                the Clash project is one of many approaches to "circuit design using a
                functional/declarative language". This talk will explore some of those options,
                how the Clash approach compares to them: what has worked well for Clash and in
                what aspects other options will most likely always be better.

                <p>
                    A major challenge with the practical deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) is how to develop the high-quality code needed in order to produce robust and secure IoT devices.  In other domains, high-level programming languages have shown to be efficient vehicles towards this.  However, the very limited compute power provided by IoT devices have made it difficult to apply the same approach to IoT devices.  The Cephalopode processor is an attempt at implementing a low power hardware device directly aimed at running a high-level functional language.  By integrating many resource-heavy tasks like garbage collection, arbitrary precision arithmetic, process management and scheduling, etc.  into dedicated hardware, the Cephalopode processor explore the hypothesis that high-level functional languages can be used even for low-power IoT devices.
                </p><p>
                    The talk will provide an overview of the Cephalopode project, including stops at the input language, the compiler, the processor architecture, the tool environment we created to design the processor, as well as some early results on the practicality of the approach.

                    This talk is a look back on work published at ISMM 2020, on
    how the language features and data structures typical in OCaml conspire to
    have interesting memory-system performance effects that result in different
    optimisation strategies in both hardware and software from imperative
    languages. I will discuss the unique design patterns for software
    prefetching that can be used to alleviate these, the reasons for different
    parts of the modern microarchitecture stack reacting unusually to the code
    and with varying levels of success, the factors that matter for other
    languages, and ways forward for both next-generation hardware and software.

                    Implementations of general purpose functional languages overwhelmingly target
                    CPUs. This choice is despite the semantic gap between their high-level execution
                    model and CPU assembly. Meanwhile, advances in FPGAs continue to improve the
                    density of <i>custom</i> hardware resources offered to wide audiences. We consider
                    this a call to reinvestigate <i>hardware</i> implementations of functional languages.
                    We present “Heron”, a special purpose processor core for pure, non-strict
                    functional languages. This talk recaps Heron's reduction core, compares its
                    performance to a variety of stock CPU implementations, and presents work
                    towards its concurrent hardware garbage collector.

                    This talk presents PipelineC, an open source project which sits between
                    traditional register transfer language (RTL) and high-level synthesis (HLS).
                    PipelineC aims to make hardware design accessible to domain specialists with
                    basic programming skills by using C-like syntax. Major features include: timing
                    feedback from synthesis and place and route (PnR) tools that drives automatic
                    pipelining of combinatorial logic, as well as derived finite state machines and
                    global point to point wires/clock crossings for composing complex designs

                    Building your first silicon prototype can be a significant effort. There is
                    always more work that you could do before your tapeout deadline and so balancing
                    risk with opportunity is key. By exploiting open-source infrastructure (in our
                    team's case, OpenPiton) and making long term decisions, you can build chips with
                    increasing capabilities. In this talk I will share our team's experience on the
                    design side (rather than backend) that can make tapeouts more achievable.

		    When running quantum circuits on a quantum computer, we're dealing with
		    a world with very different capabilities to the classical one in which
		    they were generated. For example, the famous "No-cloning Theorem" means
		    that arbitrary values cannot be copied. If these differences aren't
		    respected, it can lead to very costly runtime errors.</p>
		    <p>
		    In this talk, I will present BRAT: a functional programming language for
		    writing programs which interleave quantum and classical execution, and
		    quantum resource limitations are enforced by the type system. Moreover,
		    programs in the two worlds are united by a compositional syntax, thanks
		    to their affinities for monoidal structure.</p>
